description: This happened a very few years after, my marriage, and is one of those
  feeling incidents in life that we never forget. My husband's income was moderate,
  and we found it necessary to deny ourselves many little articles of ornament and
  luxury, to the end that there might be no serious abatement in the comforts of life.
  In furnishing our house, we had been obliged to content ourselves mainly with things
  useful. Our parlor could boast of nine cane-seat chairs; one high-backed cane-seat
  rocking chair; a pair of card tables; a pair of ottomans, the covers for which I
  had worked in worsted; and a few illustrated books upon the card tables. There were
  no pictures on the walls, nor ornaments on the mantle pieces. For a time after my
  marriage with Mr. Smith, I did not think much about the plainness of our style of
  living; but after a while, contracts between my own parlors and those of one or
  two friends, would take place in my mind; and I often found myself wishing that
  we could afford a set of candelabras, a pair of china vases, or some choice pieces
  of Bohemian glass. In fact, I set my heart on something of the kind, though I concealed
  the weakness from my husband. Time stole on, and one increase after another to our
  family, kept up the necessity for careful expenditure, and at no time was there
  money enough in the purse to justify any outlay beyond what the wants of the household
  required.
